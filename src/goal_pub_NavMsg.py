""" Code modified by: Dominic Larkin 5FEB2016

    
    Command a robot to move autonomously among a number of goal locations defined in the map frame.
    Attempt to move to each location in succession.  Keep track of success rate, time elapsed, and 
    total distance traveled. The goal locations are determined by adding distances to the current
    location of the robot on the map.

    based on nav_test.py - Version 0.1 2012-01-10. Modified for use with West Point Robotics.
